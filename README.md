## 👨‍💻 About Me:

I am a passionate computer science (M.Sc.) student and former professional football player from Germany, now dedicated to leveraging technology in the field of innovation management. In my role as a developer, I work with a diverse set of technologies to enhance creativity and efficiency in business processes. Alongside my professional work, I also serve as a lecturer in statistics at my university, where I teach students about data analysis, statistical methods, and the value of data-driven decision-making.
